# A SolidStart experiment

Based on the SOFA methodology I want to try out these things in no particular order:

- Add an ORM to the project, I would like to try [DrizzleORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- Maybe setup a dev-container for development and ease of use with a database like Postgres
- Get familiar with SolidJS to see if I like it
- setup github actions for testing (unit and e2e)

## Functionality

The project will do:

- authentication
- display of the users
- display of some messages sent by the users
